Development issues:

General improvements (low priority):
	Edit framework of local2remote to make it so the end-user doesn't actually have to modify a function.

Improvements suggested Before upgrading to be compatible with Psychtoolbox version 3:

Documentation:
	Contents for every directory
	Tutorial for new users/programmers
	Document display routines
	Document stimulus types for users and programmers
	Document script types for users and programmers

NewStimServices
	Make an abstract parallel board interface; the PCIDIO96 should be a special case of this

Triggering options/NewStimDisplayProcs
	Develop a more generic means of triggering/reporting that relies on NewStimServices
	Intrinsic -> slave mode, adjust parallel port

How to upgrade to Psychtoolbox version 3:

All NewStimServices need to be upgraded to operate on multiple platforms
Likely will need a second set of DisplayProcs, one for each platform
All stimulus/loadstim.m files need to be updated, to use the appropriate stimulus drawing methods

% The NewStim package offers a framework for 2 types of remote communication.
%  
%   One mode is 'sockets', which uses the unix sockets framework to transmit information and files.
%     The sockets mode is fully developed but had not been extensively tested.
%
%      Configuration of sockets: Look at the file NewStimCalibrate for assistance
%         
%
%   The mode that has been used in all implementations thus far is the 'filesystem' mode of remote
%      communication; this is very well tested and works well.  In this mode, the 'master' computer
%      and the 'slave' computer both mount the same drive, using their operating systems.  (For example
%      the master computer might share one of it's drives, and the slave computer might mount that drive
%      before launching Matlab; or both master and slave might mount a drive on a third computer.)

%      Configuration of filesystem: Look at the NewStimCalibrate for assistance
% 
%      How to use this mode as a programmer:
%
%        Use the functions SENDREMOTECOMMAND and SENDREMOTECOMMANDVAR to dispatch commands
%           and files to the remote machine.
%

For filesystem,

master machine writes a script file 'runit.m' to the remote directory.  The remote computer checks for the
exitence of this file and tries to run it.  The files 'toremote' is traditionally used to transmit information
to the remote computer and any script that needs variable input from the master machine will try to load this
file.  Scripts running remotely can write a file called 'gotit' to indicate to the host that they are finished.
